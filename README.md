# Note Keeper

It is a basic project to store and display for keeping notes based on a Udemy tutorial. This project is made using [flutter framework](https://flutter.io) by google.

Best part of this freamework is that only one code base is sufficient for the development of Android,iOS,Web,and Desktop apps.

# Motive

My main motive for this project is to learn together since learning a new technology alone is quite boring thats why i would love if you guys folk it and add new things to it so that i to can learn from it.
